# Python Snake Game :wink:

Here's a short poem:

### From within python emerged another python,
### A real reptile, and not the language,
### Sliding left, sliding right, it's on a rampage,
### Eating this, eating that, well it's at that age.
___
### With every bite, it's getting longer,
### Its smart and weary of hitting the border,
### Because it's constrained by its coder
### It knows that someday it will live no longer
### So till that day, it does what makes it happiest.

## Sssssssliding, Ssssssslithering and Sssssssnacking
